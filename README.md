Lock'n'Roll extended
====================
This is a slightly extended version of the original plugin « Lock'n'Roll » created by <a href="http://csammisrun.net/blog/category/locknroll/">Chris Sammis</a>.

It allows you to select which status should be set on your accounts in Pidgin when your workstation is locked.

<blockquote>
One of the computer decisions I make on a frequent basis is to get up and walk away from it, locking the workstation as I go. Sadly, Pidgin, the IM client I use at work, remains blissfully ignorant of my choice. Other IM clients automatically set the account status to “Away” when the workstation is locked, but Pidgin does no such thing…until now.

I’ve created a Pidgin plugin called Lock ‘n’ Roll that will set any active accounts to Away (with a user-defined message if applicable) when the workstation locks, and back to Available when it is unlocked. If an account has an existing away message set, Lock ‘n’ Roll leaves it alone.
